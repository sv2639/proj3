        "This project involves students in the implementation and analysis of a meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack against a simplified block cipher called mini block cipher based on the idea of the SAES (FYI, it is better to\n",
        "use the simplified DES). The primary goal is to provide hands-on experience with the MITM attack, showcasing its effectiveness against certain cryptographic algorithms and understanding why modern ciphers like AES are designed to be immune to such attacks.\n",

        "MITM or Meet-in-the-Middle Attack” is an exhaustive key search attack1.

        "SAES starts with the key expansion, then works on encryption to get ciphertext and on decryption to recover the plaintext. The key expansion generates three keys. The first key, Key0, is used for the add round key to the plaintext. The second key, Key1, is used to perform Round 1 transformation on state, defined as encrypt_round1(). The third key, Key2, is used to perform Round 2 transformations on state,\n",
